This Library Management application is built using React, React Router, and Redux, and is styled using Tailwind CSS. It features a navigation bar with links to "Home", "Browse Books", and "Add Book", making it easy for users to navigate between pages. On the Browse Books page, users can view a list of books which can be filtered by category using dynamic routes (e.g., /books/fiction). The page also includes a search bar that allows users to filter books by title or author in real time. Each book displayed has a 
"View Details" link that navigates to a dedicated Book Details page. This page shows detailed information such as the bookâ€™s title, author, description, and rating,
along with a link to return to the Browse Books page.

The Add Book page contains a form for users to submit 
new books to the collection. Redux is used to manage the state of the book list, ensuring the new book is stored and reflected in the Browse Books page after form submission. 
The form includes validation to ensure all fields are filled before allowing submission. A 404 Not Found page is also included to handle undefined routes, with a link that
takes users back to the Home page. Overall, the application uses dynamic routing, state management, form validation, and search/filter features to provide a complete and
interactive user experience
